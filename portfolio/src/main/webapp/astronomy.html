            <p>Gaming isn't my only thing that I like to do.
                I have an avid interest in space, space exploration,
                astronomy, and astrophysics. While I do not have a telescope
                to show pictures from, I can show some representations of
                stellar phenomena through a game: Elite Dangerous. I will give examples 
                of a few of these phenomena below:

                <h2>Gravitational Lensing and Black Holes</h2>
            </a>
            </br>
            <p>Black Holes are by far the most weird phenomena that are present within
                our universe. These objects are points where gravity is so strong that the 
                object's escape velocity is greater than the speed of light (often denoted as 
                c which is 300,000,000 m/s). Black holes are formed from the death of very heavy stars
                between 2 to 3 times the mass of the Sun. Black holes are often associated with
                the movement of time, as the gravitational influence of these objects
                effectively slow time down to a crawl. These objects are effectively invisible 
                on all bands of the electromagnetic spctrum and can be detected by a few means:

                <li>Gravitaional Lensing</li>
                <li>Gravitaional disturbances of objects around the black hole</li>
                <li>X-ray/Gamma Ray emmissions from ejected matter</li>
                <li>Etc...</li>
            </ul>

            <a id="BigStar">
                <h2>VY Canis Majoris: One Huge Star</h2>
            </a>
            </br>
            <p>VY Canis Majoris is one of the largest stars that humanity has ever discovered. With a radius
                of 613.85 million milesm(around 1,419 times larger than our star, the Sun.) and a mass of around
                17 solar masses (17 times "heavier" than the Sun). This star is a red hypergiant, one of the largest
                classes of red supergiants known to astronomers today. This star is absolutely gigantic in size.
                If it were superimposed atop the Sun, it would extend out to around the orbit of Saturn, give-or-take!
                Luckily this star is around 3,960 light years (1.2 kiloparsecs) away!

                <h2>Neutron Stars</h2>
            </a>
            </br>
            <p>Neutron stars are the second stellar corpses that I am talking about
                here. Neutron stars are generated when heavier stars die in supernova 
                explosions of around 1.4 and up times the mass of the sun. Neutron stars
                are odd because once formed, these objects spin at very high speeds, on the order
                of thousands of times a second.
