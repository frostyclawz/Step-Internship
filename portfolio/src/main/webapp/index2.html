            <p>As an avid gamer, I thought that I would make a 
                list of my favorite games to play and/or have 
                completed!

            <p>Destiny, as a franchise, has become one of my favorite games to play
                over the nearly six years that the franchise has been around. With this,
                the action-FPS MMO-lite science fantasy game proves to draw me in with its
                captivating lore and theorizing potential. While the current content for the 
                game Destiny 2 has been lacking overall... I will continue to play the major 
                franchise that I have come to love.

            </br>
            <p>Smite is one of the games that I enjoy to play every so often. Whether it be
                when I'm bored or when I am not playing Destiny, Smite is usually a mostly
                enjoyable experience. Smite is a MOBA played in the third-person perspective
                rather than the usual bird's-eye view. It plays pactically like your normal 
                MOBA like League of Legends or DOTA 2 with very similar mechanics. All of the 
                characters you play as are gods and goddesses of pantheons long gone...
                (or various monsters and literary gods). Despite the frustration with balancing,
                the game proves to be a fun game to sit down and play from time to time.

            <p>Spyro is one of those franchises I've been interested in without playing the main games 
                of the franchise. Maybe just because of my love for dragons! Having the original
                three games remastered for modern consoles was an awesome thing to see and immediately 
                garnered a preorder from me. Being able to finally experience the original trilogy of 
                games in an updated fashion was an amazing experience. I've always had a fondness
                of older gamees, and getting to play a remake of of these games was simply...
                awesome.
